### README:

This is a repository for a work day scheduler.
In this repository, you will be see the current day for the day, color-coded time blocks depending on the time of the day (if the time has already passed, it will be a grey block, if it is that current hour, it will be a red block, and if it a later hour in the day, it will be a green block).
Users will have the ability to update and save their updates in the scheduler for that day.
